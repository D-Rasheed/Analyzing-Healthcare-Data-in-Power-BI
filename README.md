# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-in-Power-BI


### Overview
This project explores a healthcare dataset to analyze hospital efficiency for HealthStat, a fictional consulting company. The focus is on uncovering insights into patient length of stay (LOS), cost per discharge, and hospital benchmarking. The project demonstrates advanced Power BI skills, including DAX calculations and interactive dashboard creation.

### Key Features
#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Measures efficiency in healthcare through initial analytics.
- Analyzes hospital discharges and LOS.
#### Hospital Performance Benchmarking:
- Identifies outliers and attributes impacting efficiency.
- Performs cost and root-cause analyses.
#### Interactive Dashboard:
- Incorporates HealthStat branding for polished visuals.
- Includes dynamic navigation and titles for user-friendly interaction.
### Results
- Highlighted factors affecting LOS and costs across hospitals.
- Benchmarked performance to identify inefficiencies and propose improvements.
- Delivered a dynamic, interactive dashboard for comprehensive insights.
### Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard design.
- DAX for calculated measures and custom analytics.
- Power Query for data transformation and cleaning.
